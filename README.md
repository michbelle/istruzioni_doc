# Docker instruction

Follow instruction on this [site](https://collabnix.com/introducing-new-docker-cli-api-support-for-nvidia-gpus-under-docker-engine-19-03-0-beta-release/) and this [site](https://mc.ai/rviz-on-docker/) for using gpu inside docker.

### launch a docker from image

##### for normal docker

```sh
docker run -it --name ______  image(ex. ubuntu) 
```
##### for nvidia docker

use gpu and not cpu for grapich  

First run   
```sh
xhost +local:docker
```

then
```sh
docker run -it --gpus all --env=DISPLAY --env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix ros2_foxy /bin/bash
```

### start a container

```sh
docker start ______
```
### execute other commands on existing and alive docker
to launch the terminal in bash mode from ____ docker
```sh
docker exec -it ______ bash
```
Work fine with rviz and gazebo.  
maybe need a restart:
```sh
service docker restart
```

if it doesn't work and a error like this pop up  
```sh
libGL error:.....
```

then you should check that your machine and your docker have the same nvidia driver.  
download nvidia driver from site and run this commands:  
```sh
chmod +x NVIDIA-DRIVER.run
./NVIDIA-DRIVER.run -a -N --ui=none --no-kernel-module
```

first one to avoid not sudo access
